# Do not include files and directories created by your personal work environment, such as the IDE
# you use, except for those already listed here. Pull requests including changes to this file will
# not be accepted.

# This .gitignore file contains rules for files generated by working with CircuitPython libraries,
# including building Sphinx, testing with pip, and creating a virual environment, as well as the
# MacOS and IDE-specific files generated by using MacOS in general, or the PyCharm or VSCode IDEs.

# If you find that there are files being generated on your machine that should not be included in
# your git commit, you should create a .gitignore_global file on your computer to include the
# files created by your personal setup. To do so, follow the two steps below.

# First, create a file called .gitignore_global somewhere convenient for you, and add rules for
# the files you want to exclude from git commits.

# Second, configure Git to use the exclude file for all Git repositories by running the
# following via commandline, replacing "path/to/your/" with the actual path to your newly created
# .gitignore_global file:
# git config --global core.excludesfile path/to/your/.gitignore_global

# CircuitPython-specific files
*.mpy

# Python-specific files
__pycache__
*.pyc

# Sphinx build-specific files
_build

# This file results from running `pip -e install .` in a local repository
*.egg-info

# Virtual environment-specific files
.env

# MacOS-specific files
*.DS_Store

# IDE-specific files
.idea
.vscode
